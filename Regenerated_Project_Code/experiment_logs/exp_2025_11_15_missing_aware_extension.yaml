notes: >
  Implemented the SMART-style attention path (temporal mask biasing + mask-aware feature pooling)
  and gated it behind --missing_aware_extension so baseline ConCare remains unchanged. Awaiting
  GPU time to pretrain/fine-tune with the new path; metrics will be populated after the first run.
